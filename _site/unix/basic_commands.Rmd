## Basics {#slide1}

 - Commands are separated by a new line (Enter, Return) or a semicolon (;)
 - The first word in a command is what you are asking the computer to do (a function)
 - Spaces are used to separate file names, commands, etc. 
 - Some commands allow you to customize their output with options
	- These are single letters, a word, or several words preceded by `-` or `--`
 - You can get help for a command by using the help option (either `-h` , `--help` ) or the command `man` (for manual)
	
### <b>
<div class="code">

```
ls --help
man ls
```
</div>
### </b>


## About spaces and file names {#slide2}

 - Put name in quotes if it has spaces (test code below)

### <b>
<div class="code">

```
touch Programming Class.txt
ls

touch "Programming Class.txt"
ls
```
</div>
### </b>

 
 - Quotes are NORMALLY (not always) interchangeable  (test code below)

### <b>
<div class="code">
```
echo "This is good"
echo 'This is good'
```
</div>
### </b>

- Do not start with one quote type and end with another

## Shortcuts {#slide3}


 - <span class="code">`~` </span>or <span class="code">`$HOME` </span>: your home folder (can be defined by the user)
 - <span class="code">`.`</span> : the folder that you are currently in
 - <span class="code">`..`</span>: the folder that contains the one you are currently in
 - <span class="code">`Ctrl+C`</span>: cancel a command
 - In MobaxTerm, find and modify useful shortcuts by clicking on Settings -> Keyboard shortcuts

## Shortcuts {#slide4}
 - <span class="code">`whoami`</span>
	- prints your username (if saved in the computer)
- Use `tab` to complete words 
- In a current command or in a text file, move the cursor faster by using `Ctrl+Arrow` (right or left arrow in a command line, in a text file up and down arrow too) (this works everywhere!!!)


## Basic commands {#slide5}

		
 - <span class="code">`cd`</span>
	- acronym for "change directory" (directory = folder)
	- If used alone, opens your home folder
	- The name of the folder to which you want to go comes after `cd` 
		- `cd` , `cd ~` and `cd $HOME` are synonyms
	- `cd -` - takes you to the previous folder

## Basic commands {#slide6}

 - <span class="code">`pwd`</span>
	- acronym for "print working directory" (directory = folder)
	- equivalent to the R function `getwd()` or python's `os.getcwd()`
	- prints the full path to your current folder
	- A full path always starts from the root (/)

##  Basic commands {#slide7}

 - <span class="code">`ls`</span>
	- lists the contents of your current folder
	- Check [slide 2](#2) where we used this command
 - Use <span class="code">`>`</span> after a command to save the output
	
### <b>
<div class="code">
```
pwd > myFolder
cat myFolder
```
</div>	

### </b>

- Use <span class="code">`>>`</span> to add the current output to a previous file
	
### <b>
<div class="code">
```
ls >> myFolder
cat myFolder
```
</div>	
### </b>


## Managing text files {#slide8}

- <span class="code">`cat`</span> : prints the contents of the file to the screen (check [slide 5](#5))
	- Do not use it with files are that not text (images, pdfs, compressed files) or is too big
	- If several files names are put after the command, one file is printed followed by the next (conCATenation)
- <span class="code">`head`</span> and <span class="code">`tail`</span>: prints to the screen the first/last 10 lines of the file 

## Managing text files {#slide9}

- <span class="code">`less`</span> : opens the file as "read-only"
	- Search for a word in a file inside less by typing "/" followed by the word
	- To close less, press Q
- <span class="code">`more`</span> : opens the file as "read-only", when the file is closed, prints it to the screen


## Managing text files {#slide10}

- <span class="code">`nano`</span> : open a text file to edit it.
- <span class="code">`grep`</span> : searches for a word/phrase in the file and prints the lines that match
	- Can search for several phrases (one per line) in a file by using the option `-f`
	- If you don't care about the upper/lower case, use the option `-i` or `--ignore-case`

## Managing text files {#slide11}

### <b>
<div class="code">
\# <span style="color: white">Search for lines that have the word programming in the file myFolder created in [slide7](#7)</span>

`grep "Programming" myFolder`
	
</div>	
### </b>

- <span class="code">`wc`</span> : word count. Counts the number of characters, words and lines in a file
- <span class="code">`echo`</span> : repeats the text that follows it (check [slide 2](#2))

## Exercise {#slide12}

- Save a fasta file into your home folder with the name myFasta.fa
- Use `grep` to find all the lines with sequence IDs.
	- Note - put the word or phrase you will search for inside `""`

## Exercise - Solution {#slide13}

- Save a fasta file into your home folder with the name myFasta.fa
- Use `grep` to find all the lines with sequence IDs.
	- Note - put the word or phrase you will search for inside `""`

### <b>
<div class="code">
\#<span style="color: white"> In all fasta files, the sequence ID line is indicated by the symbol >, so we just need to look for it</span>

`grep ">" myFasta.fa`

</div>	
### </b>

- Normally, if you just search for one word, the quotes are not needed, by in this case, the symbol `">"` could also mean "send the output to", which would replace the myFasta.fa file

## Managing files {#slide14}

- <span class="code">`cp`</span> : acronym for copy
	- <span class="code">`cp file file2`</span> : creates a copy of the file "file" and saves it in the file "file2"
	- <span class="code">`cp file folder`</span> : creates a copy of the file "file" and saves it with the same name in the folder "folder"
	- <span class="code">`cp file file2 folder`</span>: both files "file" and "file2" are copied into the folder "folder" with the same names
	- <span class="code">`cp folder folder2 -r`</span> : the option -r allows the copy of the entire folder.
		- If folder2 doesn't exist, it will be created to hold the same files as "folder"
		- If folder2 exists, a copy of "folder" will be created inside of folder2

## Managing files {#slide15}

- <span class="code">`mv`</span> : acronym for move. Move file from one place to another
	- <span class="code">`mv file file2`</span> : renames "file" as "file2"
	- <span class="code">`mv file folder`</span> : moves "file" into the folder "folder"
	- <span class="code">`mv file file2 folder`</span>: both files "file" and "file2" are moved into the folder "folder" with the same names
	- <span class="code">`mv folder folder2`</span> : 
		- If folder2 doesn't exist, it is the same as renaming "folder" as "folder2"
		- If folder2 exists, "folder" is moved to that folder

## Managing files {#slide16}

- <span class="code">`rm`</span> : acronym for remove. Deletes files. **They are PERMANENTELY deleted, there is no trash bin here!!!!!!!**
	- <span class="code">`rm file file2`</span> : deletes both files
	- <span class="code">`rm file file2 -i`</span> : asks the user if they really want to delete each file, if `y` is pressed, the file is deleted (`-i` for interactive)

## Managing folders {#slide17}

- <span class="code">`mkdir`</span> : acronym for "make directory". Creates new folders with the specified names. 
	- Gives an error if something with the same name already exists in the current folder. 
	- If many names are given (separated by spaces, creates all names folders)
- <span class="code">`rmdir`</span> : acronym for "remove directory". Deletes **_empty_** folders. 
	- If the folder is not empty, gives an error.
	- If many names are given (separated by spaces, deletes all names folders **if they are empty**
- <span class="code">`rm -r folder`</span> : as in `cp`, the option `-r` allows the `rm` to work with a folder. It deletes everything in the folder, then deletes the folder itself
