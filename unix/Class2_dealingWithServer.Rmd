## Logging in {#slide1}

<center>
![](../unix/MobaxTerm_SSHsession.jpg){width=60%}
</center>
- Click on `Session` -> `SSH`
- Add the `Remote Host` : cedar.computecanada.ca
- Click on `Specify username` then add yours
- Click OK: will ask your password (when you type, nothing will appear, but it is writing)

## Logging in {#slide2}

<center>
![](../unix/MobaxTerm_ssh.jpg){width=60%}
</center>

- <span class="code">`ssh cedar.computecanada.ca`</span>
	- Will ask your user name then your password (what you type won't appear on the screen)
- <span class="code">`ssh YOUR_USERNAME@cedar.computecanada.ca`</span>
	- Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your username, in my case: `karencgs`
	- Will ask your password (what you type won't appear on the screen)

## Server organization {#slide3}

- In the server, type (do not consider what comes after #):

### <b>
<div class="code">
```
pwd # after you log in, should be /home/username/
whoami # username
echo "$SCRATCH"
echo "$HOME"
ls $HOME/projects/
```
</div>
### </b>

- `$HOME` :  Store scripts, software files, things you use frequently without necessarily modifying them
- `$SCRATCH` : Use to run scripts, submit jobs (scripts that take too long or use a lot of resources)
- `/projects/account/username` : Use as medium to long term storage (raw data, final results of analyses)

## Transfer files to server {#slide4}

<center>
![](../unix/MobaxTerm_transferSFTP.jpg){width=60%}
</center>

- In MobaxTerm, after logging in to the server, click on the left panel on the world button (SFTP)
- Under the "Quick connect" bar on the left, there are buttons for upload, download, etc.
- Under the buttons is a bar to put the path to the desired folder
- Once you are in the folder you want, click on a file and click the button for download to select where you want to save it

## Transfer files to server {#slide5}

- `rsync` : transfer to and from server
	- To enter path to server, you need to add the log in info
	- Path to file(s) to transfer
	- Path to destination
	
### <b>
<div class="code">
```
rsync file_in_computer username@cedar.computecanada.ca:/home/username/
# Will ask for password to server
# copies file_in_computer to the server in the folder /home/username

rsync username@cedar.computecanada.ca:/home/username/file_in_server ./
# Will ask for password to server
# copies /home/username/file_in_server from the server my computer

```
</div>
### </b>
